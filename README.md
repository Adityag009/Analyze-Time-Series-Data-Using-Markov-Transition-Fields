# Analyze-Time-Series-Data-Using-Markov-Transition-Fields
A Markov transition field (MTF) is a matrix that indicates the transition probability of the datapoints at different time steps. A Markov transition field is constructed by unwrapping the Markov Matrix and assigning the transition probabilities to corresponding time steps.
